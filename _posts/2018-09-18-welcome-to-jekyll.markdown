You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight javascript %}
<SCRIPT LANGUAGE="JavaScript">
var now = new Date();

var days = new Array('Sunday','Monday','Tuesday','Wednesday','Thursday','Friday','Saturday');

var months = new Array('January','February','March','April','May','June','July','August','September','October','November','December');

var date = ((now.getDate()<10) ? "0" : "")+ now.getDate();

function fourdigits(number)	{
	return (number < 1000) ? number + 1900 : number;
								}
today =  days[now.getDay()] + ", " +
         months[now.getMonth()] + " " +
         date + ", " +
         (fourdigits(now.getYear())) ;

document.write(today);
</script>
{% endhighlight %}
